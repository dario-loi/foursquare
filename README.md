# Foursquare Next-POI Prediction

The repository contains code for end-to-end training and testing of a transformer based Hierarchical Graph Neural Network that performs next-POI prediction on time series extracted from the New York foursquare dataset (dataset 2 [here](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset)).

Our implementation beats the one presented in the [paper](https://bhooi.github.io/papers/hmt_sigir22.pdf) on all reported metrics, a detailed description of the methods used and the results achieved can be found in the attached report [here](https://github.com/dario-loi/foursquare/blob/master/report/report.pdf).
